macro "dFF_macro" {

// this macro creates from a time series with n frames a series with n-1 frames where each frame of the original is subtracted from its following frame
// it is useful for finding/ measuring movements within a time series
// to make absolutely sure ImageJ doesn't get things mixed up, only run it with a single stack open at a time
